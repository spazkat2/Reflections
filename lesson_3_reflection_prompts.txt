1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you have several people working on the same repository or when you want others look at or use your work.
  
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you might not have been the one to make the changes in the remote and they might not work with what you are currently working on.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A branch is the ability to take your code in a different direction then the main path and experiment it. It allows us to have a working code and a maybe working code. You would use branch when you had different poeple working on some code at the same time or wanted to work on different features.
	A clone is just a copy of a repository in another place. You would use this when you need move the repository to another computer like as back up or because someone else might want to work on it.
	A fork is like a clone but it exists on GitHub and links back to the original repository. A fork over a clone would be when I want to link back to the original creator.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So you can compare them and make adjustments if they do not merge nicely.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I would something like google drive/docs. It would be hard in that you can not experiment the same way with branches. It would be easier in that all your changes are saved automatically.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	You would do this when you are not sure that your change will work right. This is nice in that you have master always working right while the other branches might not. However this can be confusing to find the branch where you want to make a change.
